# Design Decisions

This document outlines the key design decisions made during the development of the Personal Task Dashboard application.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Component Structure**
   - **Layout Components**: Reusable components like Navbar and Sidebar
   - **Feature Components**: Task, Time Tracking, and Statistics components
   - **Common Components**: Error boundaries, loaders, etc.

2. **State Management**
   - Used React Context API instead of Redux for simplicity
   - Created separate contexts for Authentication, Tasks, and Time Entries
   - Implemented custom hooks for accessing context data

3. **Routing**
   - Used React Router for navigation
   - Implemented protected routes for authenticated users
   - Maintained clean URL structure

### Backend Architecture

1. **API Design**
   - RESTful API endpoints for all resources
   - Clear naming conventions for endpoints
   - Consistent response formats

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication for stateless authentication
   - Token expiration and refresh mechanism
   - Secure password storage with bcrypt

3. **Database Design**
   - Normalized database schema
   - Proper relationships between entities
   - Indexes for frequently queried fields

## UI/UX Decisions

1. **Material-UI Framework**
   - Provides consistent, accessible components
   - Responsive grid system
   - Built-in theming support

2. **Color Scheme**
   - Primary color: #3f51b5 (Indigo)
   - Secondary color: #f50057 (Pink)
   - Neutral colors for content areas
   - High contrast for readability

3. **Layout**
   - Sidebar navigation for easy access to main features
   - Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Card-based UI for clear content separation

4. **User Experience**
   - Form validation with clear error messages
   - Loading states for asynchronous operations
   - Animations for state transitions
   - Consistent action buttons

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Indexed frequently queried fields
   - Limited result sets for large queries
   - Efficient join operations

2. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Minimized re-renders with proper state management
   - Used memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implemented efficient list rendering

3. **API Efficiency**
   - Batched API requests where possible
   - Implemented proper caching strategies
   - Used compression for response payloads

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Secure JWT implementation
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Protection against common attacks (CSRF, XSS)

2. **Data Validation**
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource ownership validation
   - Middleware for protecting routes

## Trade-offs and Compromises

1. **Simplicity vs. Feature Richness**
   - Focused on core features for MVP
   - Prioritized user experience over feature quantity

2. **Performance vs. Development Speed**
   - Used higher-level abstractions for faster development
   - Optimized critical paths while accepting some overhead

3. **Custom vs. Third-party Components**
   - Used Material-UI to speed up development
   - Created custom components only when necessary
